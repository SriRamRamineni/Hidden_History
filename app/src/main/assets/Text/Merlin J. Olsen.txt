The larger than life bronze statue, Merlin J. Olsen Aggie All-American, is located at the south
entrance to the Romney Football Stadium (RSTAD) and commemorates the life of Merlin J. Olsen,
arguably the best known USU alum in history. Olsen was on the defensive line for USU’s football
team from 1959 to 1961. He was a three-time academic All-American at USU and graduated Summa
Cum Laude and Phi Kappa Phi in 1962 with a degree in fi nance. Olsen is a member of the Utah
Sports Hall of Fame, Utah State University Sports Hall of Fame, and USU’s All-Century Football
Team. Olsen retired from professional football in 1976 and was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall
of Fame in 1982. He also had a successful career in television and sports broadcasting. Olsen
endowed scholarships in the name of his parents in the 1970s and donated consistently to the
university. This sculpture has Merlin’s face looking toward the location of his original home where
he grew up in Logan
