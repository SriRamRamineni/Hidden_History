Located outside, Mountain Man is on the east side of the Biology and Natural Resources
building (BNR). Sculptor Michael Hamby is a retired professional football player who turned
his love of art and the outdoors into large bronze sculptures. A Utah native, Hamby has a deep
appreciation for Native American culture, animals, and the natural environment. His sculpture,
Mountain Man, captures the realism, dignity, and energy of exploring the land. Mountain
Man was unoffi cially adopted by USU students as the leading symbol for the College of
Natural Resources and was formerly placed in the courtyard east of the Natural Resources
building (NR).
