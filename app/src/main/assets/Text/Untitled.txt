Found outside on the south-facing wall of the Darryl Chase Fine Arts Center (FAC),
this Untitled piece was made during construction of the building in the 1960s and
shows the sculptor’s newly developed technique for carving raw brick. Robert
Fletcher’s father, Calvin, organized and headed the USU Department of Art from 1903
to 1949. The brick bas relief sculpture shows a group of people wearing cloak and
gown costumes in various positions of performance. Can you count how many actors
are in the piece? Appropriately placed behind the sculpture is the USU Department
of Theater Arts where you can attend various productions from Shakespeare to
musicals to intimate variety shows throughout each year. The Caine College of the
Arts Box Offi ce is located immediately below the sculpture.
