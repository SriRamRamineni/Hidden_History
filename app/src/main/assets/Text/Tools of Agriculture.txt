The Tools of Agriculture sculpture is located outside to the north of the Agricultural
Sciences building (AGRS) that completed construction in February 2012. The sculpture,
featuring 9 panels of bronze on a wall of granite and steel, is a memorial honoring
the lives of 8 USU agriculture students and their instructor who died in a tragic car
accident in September 2005. Ten students were with their instructor returning to Logan
from a fi eld trip in Tremonton, Utah when a tire blew on their 15 passenger van. Two
students survived. Each panel represents one of the men who died and shows their
specifi c agricultural interests. If you look closely, you can fi nd the initials of some men
within the panels. USU art graduate, Mark DeGraffenried sculpted the bronze panels
and artist Dan Cummings created the granite elements of the piece.
