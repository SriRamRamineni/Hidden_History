Daniel Kainz is a Pennsylvania sculptor who has spent more than 15 years mastering
the art of stone carving. Working mostly in granite or marble, he also makes artworks
out of glass and wood. This sculpture, located at the north entrance to the Fine ArtsVisual
building (FAV), shows his eloquent grasp of different materials and tools. The
various textures and surface patterns in Force of the Morning invite metaphorical
references to landscape, and the craggy monolithic shapes create a visual connection
to the surrounding mountains along the east side of campus. The granite also provides
a stark contrast to the sleek glass and brick of the Chase Fine Arts-Visual building
(FAV).
