Playground can be found on the north side of the Edith Bowen Laboratory School
(EBLS) and was made by the USU graduate, Cynthia Hailes. She earned her
MFA in sculpture in 2000 and currently teaches art courses for BYU-Idaho and the
Academy of Art University. Cynthia has said this about her work, “I seek to create
works of art that inspire, uplift, and express my own ideas of beauty, energy,
and inner life.” Playground pays tribute to the Emma Eccles Jones Center for
Early Childhood Education to the west and the Edith Bowen Laboratory School
immediately to the south. Both places provide innovative learning opportunities
for children and allow for great research and teaching opportunities with USU
students who study elementary education or early childhood education.
