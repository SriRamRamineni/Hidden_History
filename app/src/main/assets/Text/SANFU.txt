SNAFU is located on the south-east side of the Merrill-Cazier Library (LIB), and it is
one of the most popular sculptures on USU campus mainly because of its nickname
created by USU students: the yellow French fries. To accompany the yellow French
fries in the winter, USU students sometimes make their own snow sculpture of a giant
hamburger to sit beside it. Self-exiled from the mainstream art market, the sculptor
usually works in the minimalist tradition with smooth, solid-colored, geometric shapes
as shown here. The seven rectangles in this sculpture emphasize line and shape with
a clean and rational beauty while at the same time refl ecting the meaning of the title
by being in disarray. Joseph Kinnebrew is interested in how color gives sculpture a
certain spirit or action. So with SNAFU, he shows that his work is often about change
and motion from one moment to the next.
