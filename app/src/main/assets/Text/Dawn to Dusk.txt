The Dawn to Dusk sculpture is located along the sidewalk to the east of the athletic
fi eld located on the south side of the Dee Glenn Smith Spectrum (SPEC). The
sculpture is a rectangular column of granite with a copper plaque honoring one of
USU’s greatest alumns, Colonel Russel L. Maughan. Maughan was a native of Logan,
Utah and graduated from Utah State Agricultural College in 1917 before it became
Utah State University. He served in WWI as a fi ghter pilot and in WWII as a colonel in
the 8th air force in Great Britain. Dawn to Dusk honors Russel L. Maughan’s bravery
through his service in the two world wars, but it also honors his dedication for being
the fi rst pilot to complete a daylight fl ight across the continental U.S. in 1924 at only
31 years old. Colonel Maughan also won the Pulitzer Flying Cup in 1922 for setting a
new world speed record of 208.5 miles per hour. The sculpture serves as a monument
of historical remembrance reminding us all of what goals are possible through higher
education and service to your country.
