Michael Hamby’s creation of a charging bull is both commanding and realistic. This
sculpture is located at the corner of 800 East Street and 1000 North Street south of
Romney Stadium (RSTAD). The rushing movement of the bull evokes a liveliness not
often found in contemporary bronze sculpture. As the home of the Aggies (a nickname
for agricultural farmers), Utah State University’s costumed mascot is the bull, Big Blue,
who can be seen at many sporting events in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum located
behind Meet the Challenge. Not only notable for its attention to detail and its strong
depiction of fl eeting energy, the sculpture is also home to various student traditions
such as the Aggie Stampede, when students gather together on campus and march to
the sculpture together to attend a home football game in Romney Stadium (RSTAD).
