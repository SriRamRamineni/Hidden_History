The Veterans Memorial is located outside immediately to the south of the Dee Glen
Smith Spectrum (SPEC) and includes a fl agpole and granite benches. The memorial
pays tribute to all U.S. veterans of North American wars who gave their service, and
many their lives, in honor of our country. The monument is comprised of a 3,750
pound granite wall. In the middle of this wall is a sculpture of a mural carved in
granite depicting the silhouetted forms of service men and women from 8 decades of
American confl ict. Each branch of the U.S. military is recognized through the 6 panels
along the left and right sides showing the offi cial seal of each branch. The memorial
was a collaborative project headed by Brad Bingham, a cadet in the Air Force ROTC
program who graduated from USU with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in History. Bingham said
this memorial was exclusively a student project with various USU cadets meeting
with the campus planning offi ce, working with local landscapers, and launching a
fundraising campaign. The Veterans Memorial was dedicated in a public ceremony
on Veterans Day in 2003.
