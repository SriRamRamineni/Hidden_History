Concentric Arcs won the Logan Biennial National Outdoor Sculpture Competition
held at USU in 2000. Its creator, John Ohran, was born in Utah and earned degrees in
sculpture from Brigham Young University and UCLA. The piece employs a clever use
of shadows, texture, and positive and negative space. From the rusted, steel surface,
the sculpture seems to give reference to the late Industrial Age, formal architecture, or
the curves of a Roman Gladiator’s armor. It actually represents the sculptor’s focus on
the technology of today. The entire sculpture was designed and built using a computer.
Even the metal pieces of the sculpture were cut out by a computer-controlled plasma
cutter. Concentric Arcs thereby helps to further this sculptor’s emphasis on the role
of computers in the creation of art and is thoughtfully located between the Engineering
Laboratory building (ENLAB) and the Science Engineering Research building (SER).
