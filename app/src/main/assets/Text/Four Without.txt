Four Without is one of the six winners of the Logan Biennial National Outdoor Sculpture
Competition held in 2000. A complex, three-dimensional puzzle of cedar wood and
steel, the sculpture is the courtyard quartet in front of the main entrance to the Natural
Resources building (NR). “My sculpture,” said Robert Winkler, “is about the confl ict
between the limitations imposed by our individual histories and the boundless ability
of our minds to imagine other possibilities.” Such possibilities include this sculptor’s
experimentation with form. The pyramid or mountain-like forms have a seemingly
unnatural fl uidity or curviness which inspires us to look at the actual mountains to the
east. The sculpture is a great example of how artists are often inspired by shapes or
concepts from nature. Its rustic fi nish is expected to change by fading and increasing
textures as it is exposed to the elements.
