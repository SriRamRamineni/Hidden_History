The bronze sculpture Janet Quinney Lawson was added to the university’s public art
collection in 2009 and is located in front of USU’s Natural Resources building (NR).
Before her death in 2008, Janet Quinney Lawson was a strong supporter of Utah
State University, particularly in the fi elds of environmental education and conservation.
Lawson was instrumental in developing relationships between her family’s foundation
and the College of Natural Resources, specifi cally through a $5 million gift to the college
for student scholar programs, the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney Natural Resources
Library located immediately to the southwest, and new research programs. Lawson
received USU’s Distinguished Service Award in 1998 and an honorary Doctorate of
Natural Resources degree from USU in 2000.
