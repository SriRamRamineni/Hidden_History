As the only kinetic sculpture on USUâ€™s campus, Tilting Arc is always evolving into different
compositions of form and movement. George Baker was a world-renowned sculptor who
taught at the University of Southern California and Occidental College in L.A. His works are
sometimes driven by electric motors or moved by hand and they show his interests in music
and mechanics. The sculpture uses only natural means for movement as it responds to the
directions and speeds of wind currents. Blade or rudder-like forms fl oat and rotate smoothly
through the air like a silent dancer or a ship poised for fl ight. The sculpture was the last piece
the artist made before his death of cancer in 1997. After some severe wind damage to the
steel blades, the sculpture was taken down in 2006 to be repaired and was safely re-installed
in fall 2009. Other works by the artist can be found inside the neighboring building in the
collection of the Art Museum (AM).
