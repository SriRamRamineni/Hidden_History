The sculpture Troika was moved in 2010 from the Fine Arts Center Courtyard (FAC)
to the south side of the Caine College of the Arts administrative offi ces (CCA). The
simple geometric shapes of two open circles and a triangle playfully form a stylized
CCA. The title, Troika, is the Russian word for sleigh, and the three simple shapes
liken themselves to the pointed front of a plow. “Everything can be reduced to basic
geometric shapes,” Riggs said. The sculpture is fondly used as a chair. When a small
child curled up for a nap in the comfort of one of the C shapes, Riggs was delighted
that people of all ages interact with the work in such a positive way. A graduate of the
Rhode Island School of Design, Riggs was a furniture designer who helped form the
BYU Art Department and found his love of large-scale sculpture later in life.
