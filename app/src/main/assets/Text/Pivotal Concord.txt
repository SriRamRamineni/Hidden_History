David Deming was born in Cleveland, Ohio and worked as an art professor at the
University of Texas at El Paso and Austin as well as the Cleveland Institute of Art. The
steel sculpture Pivotal Concord is the largest public sculpture on USU’s campus and
appears to be a fragment from a giant computerized apparatus or abandoned factory. A
powerful image with its solid black color, the sculpture is meant to challenge the viewer
with its monumental, mechanistic, and masculine physicality and is appropriately placed
near the university’s complex of four buildings including the College of Engineering.
The sculpture is specifi cally near the Engineering Innovation building (ENINV). Deming
said, “I like the idea of the sculpture having its own pads, launching it from one area to
another. The inspiration has been the Concorde jet, bridging continents.”
