Ryoichi Suzuki was born in Tokyo, Japan and has taught sculpture at USU since
2010. His sculpture, Whispers and Silence is the newest addition to the university’s
collection of public art on campus and is located on the north side of the Agricultural
Sciences building (AGRS). It is made of Yule marble that was shipped to USU from
Colorado as a large, solid, rectangular block. Carving marble is a subtractive process,
so this required the sculptor to continually remove parts of the marble block by using
power tools to cut off big chunks or to grind away layers. The sculptor spent 3 months
working on this piece and hired several USU sculpture students to help him complete
it. He is often inspired by the soft, graceful movements of clouds or water in his work,
and this piece is meant to visualize an elongated, fl owing movement. Ryoichi refers
to this fl owing as, “the fl ow of being” or a metaphor on how our lives fl ow in certain,
unknown directions.
