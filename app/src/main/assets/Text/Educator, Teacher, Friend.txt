The bronze sculpture Educator, Teacher, Friend memorializes Emma Eccles
Jones who spent much of her life working as an elementary school teacher. The
support from her family foundation has helped USUâ€™s College of Education and
Human Services, now named in her honor, become one of the highest ranked
graduate level colleges in the nation. The college is home to the departments
of Psychology, Special Education, Early Childhood Education, Elementary
Education, and many others. The legacy of teaching left by Emma Eccles
Jones has helped the college develop many exciting new programs, including
the Center for Persons with Disabilities which generates more than $14 million
each year, the Center for the School of the Future research unit which explores
ways to improve the quality of education, and the National Center for Hearing
Assessment and Management. The Center for Hearing conducts early hearing
detection and intervention, along with a universal newborn hearing screening
test.
